# MarkdownFlow Quick Spec

## Variables

- Reference syntax: `{{var_name}}`
- No spaces in variable names
- Undefined variables resolve to `UNKNOWN`

## Interactions

- Single-select: `?[%{{var}} Option A | Option B | Option C]`
- Multi-select: `?[%{{var}} Option A || Option B || Option C]`
- Input: `?[%{{var}} ...Enter your answer]`
- Single-select + input: `?[%{{var}} Option A | Option B | ...Other, please specify]`
- Multi-select + input: `?[%{{var}} Option A || Option B || ...Other, please specify]`

### Prompt Placement Rules

- Put the learner-facing question or prompt in the script text immediately before the interaction line.
- Put each `?[]` interaction on its own line.
- Inside the interaction line, include only interaction content: option labels for select interactions, and input markers/placeholders such as `...Other` or `...Brief situation` where applicable.
- Do not place learner-facing question text after `%{{var}}`; it will become part of the interaction content.
- For input interactions, include both the full question before the interaction line and a shorter placeholder after `...`.

Correct:

```markdown
Ask the learner: Which option best matches your situation?
?[%{{choice}} Option A | Option B | Option C | ...Other]

Ask the learner: What is one specific situation where you want to apply this idea this week?
?[%{{example}} ...Brief situation]
```

Incorrect:

```markdown
?[%{{choice}} Which option best matches your situation? Option A | Option B | Option C | ...Other]
?[%{{example}} What is one situation where you want to apply this idea this week? ...Describe your situation]
Ask the learner: Which option best matches your situation? ?[%{{choice}} Option A | Option B | Option C]
```

### Input Marker Rules

- `...` is an input marker, not punctuation.
- `...` must appear immediately before the short free-text placeholder or free-text option label.
- For pure input, use `?[%{{var}} ...Short placeholder]` after a fuller learner-facing question.
- For select + input, put `...` at the start of the option that opens text entry, such as `...Other, please specify`.
- Do not move `...` to the end of the prompt text.
- Do not write `?[%{{var}} Prompt text...]`.
- Do not write `?[%{{var}} Option A | Option B | Other, please specify...]`.

### Input Marker Examples

- Correct:
  Ask the learner: What is one goal you want this lesson to help you achieve in your current work?
  ?[%{{learner_goal}} ...One-sentence goal]
- Correct: `?[%{{difficulty_type}} Concept unclear | Need practice | ...Other, please specify]`
- Incorrect: `?[%{{learner_goal}} Describe your goal in one sentence...]`
- Incorrect: `?[%{{difficulty_type}} Concept unclear | Need practice | Other, please specify...]`

## Deterministic Output

- Single-line fixed text: `===fixed text===`
- Multi-line fixed text:

```markdown
!===
Line 1
Line 2
!===
```
